              I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in full
              stack development (React.js & Node.js). I am very enthusiastic
              about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital
              products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and
              writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters to me.

              I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then,
              I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new
              challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way.
              Now, in my early thirties, 7 years after starting my web
              development journey, I'm building cutting-edge web applications
              using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs,
              Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.

              I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products
              end to end, from ideation all the way to development.
